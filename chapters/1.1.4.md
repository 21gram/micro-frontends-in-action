### 1.1.4 共享

Micro frontends is all about being able to work in small autonomous teams that have everything they need to create value for the customer. But some shared topics are essential to address when working like this.

Figure 1.8. To ensure a good end-result and avoid redundant work it’s important to address topics like web performance, design systems and knowledge sharing from the start.

Web Performance
Because we assemble a page from fragments of multiple teams, we often end up with more code that our user must download. It’s crucial to have an eye on the performance of the page from the beginning. You’ll learn useful metrics and techniques to optimize asset delivery. It’s also possible to avoid redundant framework downloads without compromising team autonomy. In chapters 10. Asset Loading and 11. Performance is Key we dive deeper into the performance aspects.

Design Systems
To ensure a consistent look and feel for the customer, it is wise to establish a Common Design System. You can think of the design system as a big box of branded LEGOs that every team can pick and choose from. But instead of plastic bricks, a design system for the web includes elements like buttons, input fields, typography, or icons. The fact that every team uses the same basic building blocks brings you a considerable way forward design-wise. In chapter 12. User Interface & Design System you’ll learn different ways of implementing a design system.

Sharing knowledge
Autonomy is essential, but you don’t want information silos. It’s not productive when every team builds an error logging infrastructure on their own. Picking a shared solution or at least adopting the work of other teams helps to stay focused on your mission. You need to create spaces and rituals that enable information exchange regularly between teams.
