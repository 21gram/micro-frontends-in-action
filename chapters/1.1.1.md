### 1.1.1  系统 & 团队

The three boxes with Teams A, B and C demonstrate the vertically arranged software systems. They form the core of this architecture. Each system is autonomous, which means it can function even when the neighbor systems are down. Every system has its own data-store to achieve this. Additionally, it doesn’t rely on synchronous calls to other systems to answer a request.

One system is owned by one team. This team works on the complete stack of the software from top to bottom. In this book, we will not cover the backend aspects like data replication between these systems. Here established solutions from the microservices world apply. We’ll focus on organizational challenges and frontend integration.

Each team has its area of expertise in which it provides value for the customer. In figure 1.2 you see an example for an e-commerce project with three teams.
