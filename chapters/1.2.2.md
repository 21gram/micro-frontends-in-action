### 1.2.2 不再有独立的巨型前端团队

Most architectures today don’t have a concept for scaling frontend development. In figure 1.10 you see three architectures: The monolith, frontend/backend-split, and microservices. They all come with a monolithic frontend. That means the frontend comes from a single codebase that only one team can work on sensibly.

Figure 1.10. In most architectures the frontend is a monolithic system.

With micro frontends, the application, including the frontend, gets split into smaller vertical systems. Each team has its own and smaller frontend. Compared to a frontend monolith building and maintaining a smaller frontend has benefits. A micro frontend …

is independently deployable.
isolates the risk of failure to a smaller area.
is narrower in scope and thereby easier to understand.
has a smaller codebase that can help when you want to refactor or replace it.
is more predictable because it does not share state with other systems.
Let’s go into detail on a few of these topics.
